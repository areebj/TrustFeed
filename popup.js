  //chrome.scripting.executeScript({ target: { tabId }, files: ["content.js"] }) tells Chrome to run content.js in the context of that webpage.This requires the "scripting" permission in your manifest and (for most pages) a matching "host_permissions" entry (we set <all_urls> so it works anywhere during dev).
  // After this runs, whatever code is in content.js will execute inside the page (weâ€™ll write that next to actually draw your widget).
  chrome.scripting.executeScript({
    target: { tabId: tab.id },
    files: ["content.js"]
  });

  // You could show a quick confirmation later
  console.log("TrustFeed widget injected into tab:", tab.url);
